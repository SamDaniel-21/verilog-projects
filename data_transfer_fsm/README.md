# Data Transfer FSM

## Overview
FSM-based data transfer controller implemented in Verilog and
verified using Vivado XSIM.

## Design Details
- Top module: top_fsm
- Dual-port RAM with asynchronous read
- Synchronous FSM-based control logic

## Verification
- Self-checking testbench
- 16 functional test cases
- 100% pass rate

## Simulation
From the sim/ directory:
